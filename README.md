SL One trip search

The app is used to perform a search for a trip in Stockholm using SL. The app communicates with API's from trafiklab.se
to fetch travel information.
You enter a trip and the app will give you information, specifically the first leg of the trip, so that you know which
bus or metro to go to and to which track.
This can be useful when changing at a hub like Slussen where many busses go in a certain direction but you don't know
which ones, at what time and from which stop they're leaving.
The app will also feature a region monitoring service so that a local notification is sent with the relevant information
as the users approaches the start station.
Further it will feature a widget that will perform a search of the specified journey when the widget starts.

Possible add-ons:
Perform the search depending on the users current location. If the user is closer to destination than start,
flip and search from destination to start...
